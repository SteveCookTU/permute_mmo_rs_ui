# **PermuteMMO - Rust Edition UI**
Core code is credited to [kwsch](https://github.com/kwsch) and relative authors for their work on [PermuteMMO](https://github.com/kwsch/PermuteMMO). 

This is a version written on Rust to be compiled to native without .NET including the infamous Web Assembly.

This project is licensed under [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) following the original repository this is based off of.

## Usage
Please read the [PermuteMMO wiki](https://github.com/kwsch/PermuteMMO/wiki) for information on how to understand the results and what files can be used.

#### Web
For the website on GitHub Pages, you can drag and drop the files you would normally used with PermuteMMO into the browser.

#### Desktop
You can drag and drop files the same as the website but you can also connect directly to the switch and read from memory. To do so, specify the connection parameters and hit connect. Then hit MMO or Outbreak to scan either of the two.
